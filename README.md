<h2>Features</h2>

The Save the Planet game incorporates the following features:

- Four unique fields representing different environmental aspects:
- Renewable Energy: Hydroelectricity, Solar Power, Wind Power
- Sustainable Transportation: Public Transport, Electric Vehicle, Bicycle
- Waste Management: Recycling, Compost
- Wildlife Conservation: Habitat Restoration, Wildlife Protection
-  Player movement and area ownership mechanics
- Points management system
- Multiple winner recognition
- Design Principles

The game's design follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles enhance modularity, maintainability, scalability, and usability. Key design practices include:

- Organizing data and methods within distinct classes
- Promoting reusability and maintainability through inheritance
- Simplifying code complexity with polymorphism
- Concealing data with abstraction
- The design allows for future enhancements and adaptations, with Java classes and methods supporting modularity and extensibility. For example, the Game class can be easily modified, and interfaces and inheritance in classes like Square and Area facilitate the addition of new game elements.

<h2>Development Process</h2>

The development process followed an Agile approach, focusing on iterative and incremental progress, enabling better communication, collaboration, and adaptability throughout the project's lifecycle. The development plan was divided into several key phases:

- Requirements Gathering and Analysis
- Design and Prototyping
- Implementation
- Iterative Development
- Integration and Testing
- Documentation and Final Review

By following an Agile development approach, the team effectively collaborated, adapted to changes, and delivered a high-quality project that met the desired objectives and requirements.
